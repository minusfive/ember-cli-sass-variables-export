  # A quirk of this addon is that first time tests are run, because of
  # the order in which the Sass compiler is invoked on ember, the
  # generated utils aren't found, so tests fail. 2nd time onwards they
  # work. Building before running tests gets around this issue.
  # Should only build if necessary.
